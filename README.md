## Overview
Challenge started on 16 Feb, 2023. Challenge completed on 20 Feb, 2023. I attempted the challenge with my mobile phone.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learnt that continuous practice is the best way to get better. It was quite easy to forget what certain functions are intended for without practice.
I recognised the need to be attentive to design details.
### Continued development
I need to get better in :
• CSS Grid & Flexbox.
• Use of Relative Units (em & rem).
• Margin & Padding.
• Responsiveness.
